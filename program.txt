Our program will implement a platformer-style game in the language Scratch. 

We expect that the program will:
  > have multiple levels, each with a unique background 
  > have multiple playable sprites with different features
  > make use of different kinds of controls for different mechanics
  > gradually build up complexity to make the game accessible to people
    unfamiliar with Scratch
  > run smoothly enough to play through Scratch's web interface
  > be split up into many 'scripts', and be incredibly modular
  
We expect the program to be approximately 500-1000 lines of code. We will
also be supplying graphics as part of our game, since we see that as an 
important part of Scratch. 

We think this program will be a good illustration of the features of our 
language because Scratch is uniquely geared toward creating games and has 
native support for graphic layering, screen positions, animations of sprites, 
and feedback responses from a user. The code will make use of Scratch's 
in-built color sensing functions which detect when a sprite is on another 
color as a core mechanic of the game. We expect that our code will also
structurally highlight Scratch's style with many small scripts that are tied 
to specific user feedback or a sprite's position.
