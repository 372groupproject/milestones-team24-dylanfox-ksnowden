Our language does not require a Makefile. 

All of the code files in this respository are either captured as a PNG image, 
to show the unique colorations and layout of Scratch files, or saved as files
with the .sb3 file extension. There are two ways to run the .sb3 files:

1) Go to https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/ and upload the files to
        the online editor and execute them there, or
2) Download the offline editor from https://scratch.mit.edu/download and
        import the project files to the application.
        
Both the online and offline editors have identical layouts, making either 
option viable. 
        
Scratch is meant to be simple to understand, and so there are no complex
rules for compiling. All you need to do is upload the .sb3 files to either 
interface, and they should be executable. Most of our programs begin by 
clicking the green flag in the top right of the screen, near the interactive
window. Other code files begin with key presses.
