Our language does not require a Makefile. 

All of the code files in this respository are either captured as a PNG image, 
to show the unique colorations and layout of Scratch files, or saved as files
with the .sb3 file extension. There are two ways to run the .sb3 files:

1) Go to https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/ and upload the files to
        the online editor and execute them there, or
2) Download the offline editor from https://scratch.mit.edu/download and
        import the project files to the application.
        
Both the online and offline editors have identical layouts, making either 
option viable. 
        
Scratch is meant to be simple to understand, and so there are no complex
rules for compiling. All you need to do is upload the .sb3 files to either 
interface, and they should be executable. Most of our programs begin by 
clicking the green flag in the top right of the screen, near the interactive
window. Other code files begin with key presses. 
        
The following is an index of all the code snippets contained in this file:

        p1_hello_world: this program makes the sprite say "hello world"
        
        p1_sprite_images: this program demonstrates the use of image assets
                for both sprites and a background
        
        p2_clone: this program demonstrates a sprite's ability to clone itself
                and begin executing code from a different script
        
        p2_forever: this program demonstrates the forever-loop control structure
        
        p2_if_else: this program demonstrates the if-else control structure
        
        p2_repeat: this program demonstrates the repeat control structure
        
        p2_simple_movement: this program installs simple handlers to allow
                the sprite to move on screen with simple movement commands
        
        p3_faliire_lists: this program demonstrates how Scratch passes by value
                rather than by reference, and the basics of the list structure
        
        p3_failure_numeric_overflow: this program demonstrates how Scratch handles
                data errors, specifically how it will continue executing code which
                isn't affected by the error
        
        p3_int_string: this program demonstrates the exentsive polymorphism and 
                type inference in Scratch which allows the functions to be 
                understood by its audience
        
        p4_clone: this program is another demonstration of cloning
        
        p4_key_press: this program is a more extensive version of p2_simple_movement
                which adds further complexity in handling key presses
        
        p5_recursion: this program demonstrates how Scratch functions are able
                to recurse
