All of the code files in this respository are either captured as a PNG image, 
to show the unique colorations and layout of Scratch files, or saved as files
with the .sb3 file extension. There are two ways to run these files:

1) Go to https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/ and upload the files to
        the online editor and execute them there, or
2) Download the offline editor from https://scratch.mit.edu/download and
        import the project files to the application.
        
Both the online and offline editors have identical layouts, making either 
option viable.
